Using the COINS utilities
-------------------------

Before running any of these utilities the HM Treasury COINS files should be downloaded, unzipped and placed in the "data" directory. After downloading and unzipping the COINS data released on 4th June 2010 the "data" directory should include some or all of the four files:

* fact_table_extract_2009_10.txt
* fact_table_extract_2008_09.txt
* adjustment_table_extract_2009_10.txt
* adjustment_table_extract_2008_09.txt


File formats
------------

The fact_table_extract_*.txt files are in UTF-16 format with records delimited by carriage return and fields delimited by '@'.
