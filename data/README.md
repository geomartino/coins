Coins Data Documentation

Using the COINS utilities
-------------------------

Before running any of these utilities the HM Treasury COINS files should be downloaded, unzipped and placed in the "data" directory. After downloading and unzipping the COINS data released on 4th June 2010 the "data" directory should include some or all of the four files:

* fact_table_extract_2009_10.txt
* fact_table_extract_2008_09.txt
* adjustment_table_extract_2009_10.txt
* adjustment_table_extract_2008_09.txt


File formats
------------

The fact_table_extract_*.txt files are in UTF-16 format with records delimited by carriage return and fields delimited by '@'.


Overview of COINS data
----------------------

The structure of the COINS data is explained in  [HM Treasury - Understanding the COINS data](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/coins_guidance_040610.pdf).

The documents on the [Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 2010](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pespub_pesa10_natstats.htm) page are useful. The meaning of the terms used (DEL, AME, outrun etc) is explained in the [PESA 2010 National Statistics release](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pespub_pesa10_natstats.htm), in the 'How to use PESA' section and in Chapter 1 'Departmental Budgets'.

The documents on the [Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 2009](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pespub_pesa09.htm) page are also useful, in particular the Introduction and Chapter 1 of [Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 2009](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/pesa_180609.pdf)


###Very brief summary

The Treasury maintains data for recorded spending (outturn), forecast spending (estimated outturn for the latest year) and planned spending (up to three years ahead). The COINS data also includes snapshots of the spending data. The "Data_type" field has values that reflect this, including "Outturn", "Forecast Outturn <month>" (eg "Forecast Outturn March"), "Plans" and "Snapshot<n>".

To give an indication of the proportion of each of the data types, the COINS *fact_table_extract_2008_09.txt* file contains 2,043,129 records that have a non-zero *value* field: of these 20,566 are outturn records, 1,610,900 are forecast records, 13,733 are plans records, and 397,930 are snapshot records.

A clear distinction is made between current and capital spending, based on Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ([GAAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAAP)). The *Resource_Capital* field has a value of "Resource" or "Capital" to reflect this.

Departments are given firm three year spending limits called Departmental Expenditure Limits (**DEL**s) within which they prioritise resources and plan ahead. Spending that cannot reasonably be subject to firm multi-year limits, or that relates to certain non-cash transactions, is included in Annually Managed Expenditure (**AME**). DEL and AME together make up Total Managed Expenditure (**TME**). The *Budget_Boundary* field has a value of "DEL", "AME" or "Not DEL/AME" to reflect this.

Spending is by department. The *Department_code* field reflects this.


Checking COINS data against PESA reports
----------------------------------------

[PESA 2010 section 1 - Budgets](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pesa2010_section1.htm) contains the budget tables. These tables contain the 2008-09 outturn figures. These figures can also be generated by SQL queries against the COINS Sqlite database, and so can be used to check that that database is correct.

The spreadsheet [Chapter 1 tables](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/pesa2010_chapter1_tables.xls) contains tables of DEL, AME and TME grouped by Resource and Capital expenditure. Full totals and subtotals by departmental group are provided. Column G (2008-09 outturn) of worksheets:
* Table 1.1 Total Managed Expenditure, 2004-05 to 2008-09
* Table 1.3 Resource budgets, 2004-05 to 2008-09 (by departmental group)
* Table 1.6 Capital budgets, 2004-05 to 2008-09 (by departmental group)
can be checked against outturn figures in the Sqlite database (coins_2008_09_sqlite.db)'derived from the fact_table_extract_2008_09.txt COINS dataset

The following worksheets may also be useful:
* Table 1.3a Near-cash in resource budgets, 2004-05 to 2008-09
* Table 1.5 Administration budgets, 2004-05 to 2008-09
* Table 1.8 Total Departmental Expenditure Limits, 2004-05 to 2008-09
* Table 1.10 Accounting adjustments, 2004-05 to 2008-09
